# JSPlayground.dev

A no-fuss JavaScript playground with instant feedback.

# Goal

It was created with the goal to provide a simple, fast and elegant playground for quickly prototyping JavaScript (and other web technologies) with instant feedback - without relying on any server dynamism.

As such, it is also a main goal to limit any future feature requests to the capabilities of what a static web server can offer.
